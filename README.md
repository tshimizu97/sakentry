# Sakentry
## Overview
This is source code for Saskentry, an iOS app that allows users to find, learn and review Sake, Japanese alcoholic beverage, just like we use Vivino for wine.

The app is under development and is planned to be released in April, 2021.

## Disclaimer
This app utilizes Firebase, and Firebase client API key is not included in this repo.
Without Firebase client API key, you can't build a functioning Sakentry app.

This repo is public just as a part of my portfolio.
